- finish model saving infrastructure
- implement preliminary versions of models
- when saving model create yaml file of the specs of the model (hyperparams and settings)

- save params of best epoch
- save graphs
    - make gif based on this link for fun: https://ransakaravihara.medium.com/how-to-create-gifs-using-matplotlib-891989d0d5ea
- create infrastructure for getting the next drawing prediction from trained model
- create a master csv file of model metrics so look up of best saved model is easy
