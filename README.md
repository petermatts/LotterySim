## Running

TODO, code is under a major refactor currently.

<!-- ## Running PowerBall -->

<!-- ### Scraping the Drawing Data

From the directory ```/src/Powerball``` run ```.\scrape.bat``` (Windows only for now, MacOS will be ```./scrape.command``` or ```./scrape.sh```) 

Or from that directory manually run ```python DrawingFreq.py``` and ```python DrawingHist.py```

### Running the Analysis

```python Analysis.py```

This will out put numbers to CSV files in accordance to their geometic probabilities based on when they were last drawn.

The files are called ```mainball.csv``` for the main balls and ```powerball.csv``` for the powerballs.

## Running MegaMillions

MegaMillions code and analysis has not yet been implemented. Come back soon. -->
